# "Ordinary differential equations in machine learning : continuous mappings"

This is the Python code I implemented for my [master's thesis](https://nemertes.library.upatras.gr/items/4f0dfba4-1ce2-4b37-a24d-63cbe0b6c8af) in 2023.

Code is based mainly on [https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq](https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq) for their paper

Chen, Ricky TQ, et al. "Neural ordinary differential equations." Advances in neural information processing systems 31 (2018).
